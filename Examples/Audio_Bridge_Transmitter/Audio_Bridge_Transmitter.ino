/****************************************************************
Example code demonstrating the use of the Arduino Library for
the BlueCreation BC127 Bluetooth Module, used on the SparkFun
BC127 Breakout and Purpletooth Jamboree boards.

This code is beerware; if you use it, please buy me (or any other
SparkFun employee) a cold beverage next time you run into one of
us at the local.

// Include the two libraries we need to use this; I'm using a software serial port
//  because time-sharing the hardware port with uploading code is a pain.
#include <bc127.h>
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>

// Create a software serial port.

// Create a BC127 and attach the software serial port to it.

String address = "20FABB0101CF"; // Remote module's address. If I were an optimist,
                                 //  I'd scan for BC127 modules and treat any one I
                                 //  found as the remote. Let's hard code for safety.

void setup()
{
  // Serial port configuration. The software port should be at 9600 baud, as that
  //  is the default speed for the BC127.
  Serial.begin(9600);

  //  it if it's lost.

    //  set to factory defaults...

    //  enable its audio input and forward the data to the remote.

    //  sit forever.
