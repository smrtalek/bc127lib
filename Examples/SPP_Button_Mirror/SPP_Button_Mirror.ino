/****************************************************************
Example code demonstrating the use of the Arduino Library for
the BlueCreation BC127 Bluetooth Module, used on the SparkFun
BC127 Breakout and Purpletooth Jamboree boards.

This code is beerware; if you use it, please buy me (or any other
SparkFun employee) a cold beverage next time you run into one of
us at the local.

  // NB- we can assume that at this point our soft serial buffer is empty; that's
  //  all handled by the restore/write/reset cycle at the top. For other programs,
  //  your mileage may vary on this point, so it might not be a bad idea to purge
  //  the buffer before you start reading in from it.
  
  // Okay, first tricky bit. Since we've got the same code on both boards, we need
  //  some way to pair them. We want to wait here until the board is paired; what
  //  we'll do is wait for the button to be pressed, and then initiate pairing. We
  //  will also monitor traffic coming in from the BC127 and watch for the string
  //  "OPEN_OK SPP\n\r"; if we see that, we can bail, since we know the module
  //  is now connected. We *could* use the connectionState() function, *but* that
  //  function has such a long latency (it takes about 500ms to get a definitive
  //  answer from the module) that the chance of missing a button press is really
  //  pretty high- you'd have to hold the button for 500ms to be sure to catch it.

    //  message polling part.
