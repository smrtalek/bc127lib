/****************************************************************
Example code demonstrating the use of the Arduino Library for
the BlueCreation BC127 Bluetooth Module, used on the SparkFun
BC127 Breakout and Purpletooth Jamboree boards.

This code is beerware; if you use it, please buy me (or any other
SparkFun employee) a cold beverage next time you run into one of
us at the local.
